      1) added TX_RECOVER state that waits for "transmit" to be
          released.  This prevents the transmission of multiple characters 
          for systems with a slowly changing transmit line.

      2) Tested on Digilent NEXYS3 FPGA at 921600 baud (55 slices consumed).
         Also tested at 300 baud (76 slices).  Not that the lower baud rate 
         consumes additional FPGA fabric since the clock dividers are larger.

      3) Problems with error at high baud rates.  Split each bit into
         8 sections.  Discarded the first three section and sampled the last 5.  
         poor results.

      4) Continued the high bit error problem by eliminating the 
         clock_divide prescaler.  Success! the system  now operated 
         error free at 91600 baud.  For this test a Digilent NEXYS3 
         board with a 100 MHz clock was used.

         The solution was to implement rx_clk and tx_clk.  These 
         counters directly count down the ticks of the high speed 
         system clock.  
  
         On the downside the complexity of the design has risen as
         has the required fabric.  The module configured for 300 baud
         now consumes 111 Macrocells in a coolrunner II.  It consumes
         79 slices in the Spartan 6.

      1) Continued work on eliminating warnings.  It seems that 
         the synthesis for a Spartan-6 is different that the 
         Spartan-3 and coolrunner.  Unable to clear warnings for both.
         This code synthesizes without warning for Coolrunner and Spartan 3.

      2) Size in CoolrunnerII is 68 to 89 macrocells.  Actual size is 
         baud rate dependent with higher rates consuming less FPGA fabric.

      3) removed recv_state and tx_state from the module output

Aaron Dahlen, 07 Apr 13: 

      1) Accepts baud_rate and clock_rate as parameters.  Auto calculates
         clock_divide.
      
      2) Now uses localparam to prevent parameter modification.

      3) Partially developed test bench, added hooks to see internal operation.  
         These should probable be removed in the future... 

      4) Eliminated warnings from the XILINX ISE 14.4 synthesizer
